The general premise of this poorly named script is to be able to quickly and accurately created playlist files of entire albums (or any folders) at a time. The personal use case was originally to be able to create a "Favorites" folder separate from my "Library" folder that could link to albums without having to have duplicate files on the storage media.

An example usage would be:

	py createPlaylist.py "C:\Users\PiwwowPants\Music\Library\Diet Cig\2017 - Swear I'm Good At This" "C:\Users\PiwwowPants\Music\Favorites"

This would create an m3u8 file of all the songs on the Diet Cig album in the Favorites folder, inside of an artist folder.
